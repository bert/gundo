<p>
A GundoSequence is a Gtk object that manages a sequence of actions that
can be undone and redone.  The structure is opaque; its members should 
be accessed only by the functions provided by the Gundo library.
<p>
GundoSequence objects provide the following signals:
<dd>
<dt>"can_undo"</dt>
<dd>Fired when the undo sequence transitions from a state where it
cannot undo actions to one where it can.</dd>
<dt>"can_redo"</dt>
<dd>Fired when the undo sequence transitions from a state where it
cannot redo actions to one where it can.</dd>
</dd>
