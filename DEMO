About the demo program
----------------------

The demo directory contains an example Gtk program that uses the undo
library.  It allows the user to draw with the mouse in the window
and undo/redo the mouse strokes that they make.  The undo, redo and
clear buttons are made sensitive/unsensitive to show when the user
can undo/clear or redo actions that they have performed.

The example program is named 'sketch'.

Drawing is performed by dragging the mouse in the window with any of
the buttons down.
